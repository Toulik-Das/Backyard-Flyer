Setup Instructions (abbreviated)
Read through the instructions below. If these commands look familiar to you, then you should use these VERY abbreviated instructions to get yourself set up.

download miniconda and then install by opening the file/app that you download.

git clone https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Term1-Starter-Kit.git to clone the starter kit and then cd FCND-Term1-Starter-Kit into that directory. If you have a windows machine, you must rename meta_windows_patch.yml to meta.yml as well.

conda env create -f environment.yml to create the miniconda environment: this took me 20 minutes to run due to the large number of installs required.

source activate fcnd to activate the environment (you'll need to do this whenever you want to work in this environment).
